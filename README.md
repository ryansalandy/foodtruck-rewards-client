# Foodtruck rewards
This is a simple aplication to track Foodtruck reward programs. Where user can create a reward, read status of a reward, update the reward, and delete reward.

Foodtruck Reward contain the following technologies:

MERN Stack
* Mongo DB
* Express
* React.js
* Node.js

V2. will need to add the actual rewards and point system.

## Planning
Started with what the resource would be and how I would CRUD on that resource. I then decided that the resource should be a digital reward card that users will create to track points. The routes where then created along with user stories, ERD, and wireframe.

### Paths & Routes
| Method | Path | Action | CRUD |
| ------ | ---- | ------ | ---- |
| POST   | /reward | create | Create |
| GET    | /reward | index  | Read |
| GET    | /reward/id | show | Read |
| PATCH  | /reward/:id | update | Update |
| DELETE | /reward/id | destroy | Delete |
